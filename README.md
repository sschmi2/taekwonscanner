Hi! Welcome to my first project.

This is a text scanner that can be used to filter Taekwondo sparring rankings.
These rankings are organized in a .txt file and were last updated in Spring 2024.
The official USA Taekwondo website keeps this information in a poorly organized and unkempt excel spreadsheet.

The goal of this project was to make these rankings more accessible and easier to understand.
I've come up with several ways to organize this data (e.g. belt level, age, weight) so athletes can see where they rank against other US competitors.

I compete in Taekwondo at the University of Washington, and my friends and I enjoyed sorting this data to find each other.
